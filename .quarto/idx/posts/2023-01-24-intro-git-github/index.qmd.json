The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.\n\n**GitHub** is an online server and user interface that provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.\n\n**Git** and **GitHub** together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: A-Solo-work-with-DIY-version-control-via-filename-B-Collaborative-work-with-DIY_W640.jpeg\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'Figure 1. Whether working solo (A) or collaborating in a group (B) version tracking by naming files is a mess when you want to retrace the steps of the analysis (C). Git and GitHub track all changes and the complete branching tree of the project (D). The commit history is a powerful tool to retrace the development of the project or can be used to roll back to any prior version.'\n#| out-width: '80%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/A-Solo-work-with-DIY-version-control-via-filename-B-Collaborative-work-with-DIY_W640.jpeg\")\n```\n\\[[Source: Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)]\n\nIt is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel [pretty interesting interview with Torvalds](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds). What it did really well was *distributed control*, and allowing everyone to have their *own copy of the repository*.\n\n*Git*/*GitHub* is now the dominant version control system with *GitHub* hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.\n\nAnother great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by [Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).\n\n## What to (not) use Git/GitHub for\n\n**GitHub is ideal if** you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.\n\n**GitHub is less useful if** you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.\n\n**GitHub also has a problem with *large files***. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. *This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file.* Therefore keep large (>50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.\n\n**Finally, if you have *data***, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories (the GitHub name for your projects) are public and everyone can see them. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data enough that it is not at risk of identifiability, then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it public, be very careful that you only make things public that are ok to be made public.\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   Git/GitHub has version control features like a turbo-charged version of \"track changes\" but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files\n-   Great for solo or collaborative work\n-   Saves the entire history of every change made\n-   Allows for multiple verisions or \"branches\" to be developed and later merged\n-   GitHub allows distributed collaboration (potentially among complete strangers) and has greatly promoted open-source software development, collaboration, distribution, and bug/issue tracking for users to get help\n-   GitHub allows *webpages* for your projects or repositories\n\n:::\n\nNote that other interfaces to *Git* exist, e.g., *Bitbucket*, but *GitHub* is the most widely used one.\n\n## Why use git/GitHub?\n\nYou want to use *GitHub* to avoid this:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: versioncontrol\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'How not to use GitHub [image from PhD Comics]'\n#| out-width: '80%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/phdversioncontrol.gif\")\n```\n\n\\[[Source: PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531)\\]\n\nTo learn a bit more about Git/GitHub and why you might want to use it, [read this article by Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).\n\n**Note her explanation of what's special with the `README.md` file on GitHub.**\n\n## How to use Git/GitHub\n\nGit/GitHub is fundamentally **based on commands you type into the command line**. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.\n\n-   [GitHub itself](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.\n-   RStudio also has [Git/GitHub integration](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.\n-   There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won't need initially, but might eventually.\n\n**Note**: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e. access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) on how to do this.\n\n# Getting Started with git\n\nOne of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan:\n\n-   <https://happygitwithr.com>\n\nIt truly is one of the **best resources** out there for getting started with git/GitHub, especially with the integration to RStudio. Therefore, at this point, I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book.\n\nSome of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I will bet that you won't regret the time investment.\n\n## Set up your profile in git on your computer\n\nAt some point you may want to make changes to your repository. Of course before GitHub allows anyone to make changes to your data, they will want to verify your identity (of course!)\n\nIn order for your computer to talk to GitHub smoothly, you will need to set up your username and email in the git profile stored on your computer. **Be sure to match** whatever username and email you used to setup your GitHub account. Easy directions are provided here <https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html>\n\n## Set up your Personal Authentication Token on your computer\n\nIn addition to GitHub knowing who you are, they will want some credentials to authenticate you are really you. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is the protocol for HTTP authentication. You will generate a personal access token for HTTPS from your GitHub account which will be stored on your personal machine. It is explained nicely here <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html>\n\n You only have to do it once for each computer, then you can push and pull from GitHub to your heartʻs content. It really is a nice way to do things securely.\n\n\n# Using git/GitHub in our course\n\nIn this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:\n\n1.  Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.\n2.  Projects 1-4 - You can practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, etc) .\n\nLearning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e. writing code as a group). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.\n\n# Clone a repo to your local directory - Easy!\n\nCloning an existing repo from GitHub is easy. Letʻs clone the **rclassdata** repo to our local git folder within your Documents folder.\n1. Go to <https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata> and click on the green **<>Code** button and copy the URL.\n```{r}\n#| label: github_cloning.png\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'Cloning from an existing repo'\n#| out-width: '100%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/github_cloning.png\")\n```\n\n2. In your Terminal or CMD prompt, navigate to your git folder (create one in Documents if you donʻt have one already), and clone the repo:\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\npwd  # or dir on PC\ncd ~/Documents/git  # navigate to your git folder\ngit clone https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata.git\n```\nIf you set up your personal access token, it should appear on your computer! [If not, set it up following these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)\n\n# Make a GitHub repo started from your local files\n\nSuppose you have some files on your computer and youʻd like to make them into a repo.  For this example, weʻre going to make a repo called **test**\n\n1. Create a folder in your `Documents/git` directory called `test` and copy some files there.\n2. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Click on the small black + on the top right corner\n```{r}\n#| label: github_new\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'Create a new repo button'\n#| out-width: '50%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/git_newrepo.png\")\n```\n\n3. Give your new repo a name (\"test\") and choose to create a blank repo with no README.md or .gitignore. We can add them later.\n```{r}\n#| label: github_create_new_repo.png\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'Set up a blank repo'\n#| out-width: '100%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/git_create_new_repo.png\")\n```\n\n4. You will see the following page giving you helpful hints for linking your GitHub repo with your local repo. We will follow the first set of instructions, slightly modified.\n```{r}\n#| label: github_quicksetup.png\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: '100%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/github_quicksetup.png\")\n```\n\nExplantations for each line of code:\n\n- `echo \"# test\" >> README.md`  Write `# test` to `README.md` which will be created since it doesnʻt already exist\n- `git init`  Intializes the local repo to set up git tracking (only need to to this once)\n- `git add .` Adds (. = all) our files and commits any changes to the repo\n- `git commit -m \"first commit\"`  Commit message\n- `git branch -M main` Renames the local branch to main\n- `git remote add origin URL` Connect the remote repo (=\"origin\" on GitHub) to our local repo. Be sure to copy the appropriate URL for your own GitHub repo.\n- `git push -u origin main` Push our local changes (in main) up to the remote (to a parallel branch main on origin).\n\n\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\necho \"# test\" >> README.md\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/mbutler808/test.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n\n::: callout-note\n# GitHub requires authentication to overwrite your repository (this is a good thing `r emojifont::emoji('smiley')``r emojifont::emoji('+1')`)\n\n- Did *GitHub* complain that it doesnʻt know your **username** or **email**?\n\nThis might be because the default info on your computer doesnʻt match what you used to register for your GitHub account. Not to worry, just set it to match your GitHub account here: <https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html>\n\n- Did *GitHub* complain that your **authentication** failed?\n\nDonʻt worry, you can set up your personal access token (I recommend the HTTPS protocol): <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html> Nice bonus, you only have to do it once for each computer.\n\n:::\n\n\n5. Check your remote repo. The files from your computer should be there!\n6. Now try pushing up another change. Make some edit to one or more local files.\n7. Add, Commit, Push:\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"made a small change\"\ngit push origin main\n```\nCheck your remote repo. Did it go up? Well done! `r emojifont::emoji('heart_eyes')`\n\nYour local files and your GitHub repository files are now synced!\n\n```{r}\n#| label: With-Git-all-contributors-have-a-copy-of-the-repo-with-all-files-and-the-full-history_W640.jpeg\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: 'Everyone is one with the repo'\n#| out-width: '80%'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"../../images/With-Git-all-contributors-have-a-copy-of-the-repo-with-all-files-and-the-full-history_W640.jpeg\")\n```\n\\[[Source: Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)]\n\n\n# A word about merge conflicts\n\nSooner or later, you will encounter a merge conflict. That happens if the same file(s) changed both locally and on GitHub.com. That can happen if multiple people work on the same files, or if you work on multiple computers and forget to always push/pull before and after you work on a project. Donʻt get discouraged, this is solvable!\n\nSometimes you have to do it manually. Moving the offending files out of your local repository, then doing the merge and after that adding the updates again can help. If you know that one source is the definite one, you can force a push or pull. A more advanced approach is to use branches.\n\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\ngit push --force\n```\n\n::: callout-warning\n- The main danger is that a force push or pull will force git to write over a conflict, and can possibly destroy someone elseʻs work. If youʻre the only one on the repo, then itʻs only your changes that youʻll lose\n- Just be aware but donʻt be afraid to practice. You can always revert back.\n- See the help page for [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push). See the -f or --force flag. Itʻs terse computer help, but if you make the effort it will start to make sense.\n- Iʻll link a more tutorial type resource later\n:::\n\n\n# Forking a repo\n\nWhen you want to build on someone elseʻs repo, that is a great time to **fork** a repo.  This happens when you donʻt have write permission to the repo, but you want provide suggestions (for example if you want to fix a bug). Or if you want to use that repo as a template or a launching off point for your own project.\n\nAfter you fork and clone the repo to your computer, you can edit, add, and commit the changes. When you are ready to submit the suggestions to the repo owner, start a **pull request**. They will then read over your suggested edits, and if they approve they can merge the changes into the working repo.\n\n**Forks** are nice because they remain connected to the parent repo in GitHub. So you can seamlessly work on your own private copy and send it back to the original project when you are ready.\n\n**Branches** work in a similar way. The idea is simple. If you have a working repo, you donʻt want to made edits or experimental changes to **main** that may break the functionality. Branches are a way to make a \"development branch\" where you can work on your ideas in private without breaking anything. When youʻre sure you have everything ironed out and working, you can merge your branch back to **main**, and delete your branch.  They are meant to be an ephemeral scratch copy to keep the project clean, organized, and working perfectly.\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.
