We will cover practical issues in data organization and management as well as programming in R and the tidyverse. Some of the topics will include: data ethics, best practices for coding and reproducible research, introduction to data visualizations, best practices for working with special data types (dates/times, text data, etc), best practices for storing data, basics of debugging, organizing and commenting code, basics of interacting with other computational resources from R. Topics in statistical data analysis, morphometrics, phylogenetic tree visualization, and other practical examples provide working examples.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nPlease look over the [Syllabus](syllabus.qmd) and [Schedule](schedule.qmd) under **General Information**.
