The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Everyone is one with the repo and all changes are tracked](../../images/A-Solo-work-with-DIY-version-control-via-filename-B-Collaborative-work-with-DIY_W640.jpeg){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\\[[Source: Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)]\n\n**GitHub** is an online server and user interface that also provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.\n\n*Git* and *GitHub* together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.\n\nIt is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel [pretty interesting interview with Torvalds](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds). What it did really well was *distributed control*, and allowing everyone to have their *own copy of the repository*.\n\n*Git*/*GitHub* is now the dominant version control system with *GitHub* hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.\n\nAnother great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by [Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).\n\n### What to (not) use Git/GitHub for\n\n**GitHub is ideal if** you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.\n\n**GitHub is less useful if** you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.\n\n**GitHub also has a problem with *large files***. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. *This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file.* Therefore keep large (>50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.\n\n**Finally, if you have *data***, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories (the GitHub name for your projects) are public and everyone can see them. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data enough that it is not at risk of identifiability, then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it public, be very careful that you only make things public that are ok to be made public.\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   Git/GitHub has version control features like a turbo-charged version of \"track changes\" but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files\n-   Great for solo or collaborative work\n-   Saves the entire history of every change made\n-   Allows for multiple verisions or \"branches\" to be developed and later merged\n-   GitHub allows distributed collaboration (potentially among complete strangers) and has greatly promoted open-source software development, collaboration, distribution, and bug/issue tracking for users to get help\n-   GitHub allows *webpages* for your projects or repositories\n\n:::\n\nNote that other interfaces to *Git* exist, e.g., *Bitbucket*, but *GitHub* is the most widely used one.\n\n### Why use git/GitHub?\n\nYou want to use *GitHub* to avoid this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How not to use GitHub [image from PhD Comics]](../../images/phdversioncontrol.gif){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\[[Source: PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive_print.php?comicid=1531)\\]\n\nTo learn a bit more about Git/GitHub and why you might want to use it, [read this article by Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).\n\n**Note her explanation of what's special with the `README.md` file on GitHub.**\n\n### How to use Git/GitHub\n\nGit/GitHub is fundamentally **based on commands you type into the command line**. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.\n\n-   [GitHub itself](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.\n-   RStudio also has [Git/GitHub integration](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.\n-   There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won't need initially, but might eventually.\n\n**Note**: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e. access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) on how to do this.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nOne of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan:\n\n-   <https://happygitwithr.com>\n\nIt truly is one of the **best resources** out there for getting started with git/GitHub, especially with the integration to RStudio. Therefore, at this point, I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book.\n\nSome of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I will bet that you won't regret the time investment.\n\n# Using git/GitHub in our course\n\nIn this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:\n\n1.  Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.\n2.  Projects 1-4 - You can practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, etc) .\n\nLearning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e. writing code as a group). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.\n\n# Clone a repo to your local directory - Easy!\n\nCloning an existing repo from GitHub is easy. Letʻs clone the **rclassdata** repo to our local git folder within your Documents folder.\n1. Go to <https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata> and click on the green **<>Code** button and copy the URL.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cloning from an existing repo](../../images/github_cloning.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n2. In your Terminal or CMD prompt, navigate to your git folder (create one in Documents if you donʻt have one already), and clone the repo:\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\npwd  # or dir on PC\ncd ~/Documents/git  # navigate to your git folder\ngit clone https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata.git\n```\nIf you set up your personal access token, it should appear on your computer! [If not, set it up following these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)\n\n# Make a GitHub repo started from your local files\n\nSuppose you have some files on your computer and youʻd like to make them into a repo.  For this example, weʻre going to make a repo called **test**\n\n1. Create a folder Documents/git directory) called **test** and copy some files there.\n2. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Click on the small black + on the top right corner\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Create a new repo button](../../images/git_newrepo.png){width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n3. Give your new repo a name (\"test\") and choose to create a blank repo with no README.md or .gitignore. We can add them later.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Set up a blank repo](../../images/git_create_new_repo.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n4. You will see the following giving you helpful hints for linking your GitHub repo with your local repo.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![How to connect your local repo with the remote](../../images/github_quicksetup.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n5. We will follow the first set of instructions, slightly modified. By line of code below:\n\n    a. First we will create our README.md file,\n    b. git init - intializes the local repo (only need to to this once - it sets up the git tracking).\n    c. Add (. = all) our files and commit them to the repo.\n    d. Create a commit message.\n    e. Renames the local branch to main.\n    f. We use \"git remote add origin URL\" to connect the remote repo (=\"origin\" on GitHub) to our local repo.\n    g. Finally we push our local files (in main) up to the remote (to a parallel branch main on origin).\n\nBe sure to copy the appropriate URL for your own GitHub repo.\n\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\necho \"# test\" >> README.md\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/mbutler808/test.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```\n6. Check your remote repo. The files from your computer should be there!\n7. Now try pushing up another change. Make some edit to one or more local files.\n8. Add, Commit, Push:\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"made a small change\"\ngit push origin main\n```\nCheck your remote repo. Did it go up? Well done! 😍\n\nYour local files and your GitHub repository files are now synced!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Everyone is one with the repo](../../images/With-Git-all-contributors-have-a-copy-of-the-repo-with-all-files-and-the-full-history_W640.jpeg){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\\[[Source: Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)]\n\n\n# A word\n\nSooner or later, you will encounter a merge conflict. That happens if the same file(s) changed both locally and on GitHub.com. That can happen if multiple people work on the same files, or if you work on multiple computers and forget to always push/pull before and after you work on a project. Donʻt get discouraged, this is solvable!\n\nSometimes you have to do it manually. Moving the offending files out of your local repository, then doing the merge and after that adding the updates again can help. If you know that one source is the definite one, you can force a push or pull. A more advanced approach is to use branches.\n\n```{.bash filename=Terminal}\ngit push --force\n```\n\n::: callout-warning\n- The main danger is that a force push or pull will force git to write over a conflict, and can possibly destroy someone elseʻs work. If youʻre the only one on the repo, then itʻs only your changes that youʻll lose\n- Just be aware but donʻt be afraid to practice. You can always revert back.\n- See the help page for [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push). See the -f or --force flag. Itʻs terse computer help, but if you make the effort it will start to make sense.\n- Iʻll link a more tutorial type resource later\n:::\n\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  What is version control?\n\n2.  What is the difference between git and GitHub?\n\n3.  What are other version controls software/tools that are available besides git?\n:::\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   [git and GitHub in the `dsbook`](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/git.html) by Rafael Irizarry\n:::\n",
