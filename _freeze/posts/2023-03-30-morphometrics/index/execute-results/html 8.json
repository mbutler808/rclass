One of those sources of variability is measurement error. \n\nMeasurement Error (ME) itself comes from many potential sources:\n\n-  the measurement device (precision)\n-  definition of the measure\n-  quality of the measured material\n-  the measurer\n-  the environment of the measurer (hopefully small!)\n-  measurement protocol\n\nWe try to minimize ME so that we can reveal the underlying patterns we are interested in, but there will always be some ME. So it is important to quantify at least once at the beginning of the study. \n\n## Protocol for assessing ME\n\nThe percentage of measurement error is defined as the within-group component of variance divided by the total (within + betwee group) variance [@Claude:2008]:\n\n$$\n\\%ME = \\frac{s^{2}_{within}}{s^{2}_{within} + s^{2}_{among}} \\times 100\n$$\n\nWe can get the componets of variance $s^{2}$ from the mean squares ($MSS$) of an ANOVA considering the individual (as a factor) source of variation. Individual here represents the within-group variation. The among and within variance can be estimated from the mean sum of squares and $m$ the number of repeated measurements:\n\n$$\ns^{2}_{among} = \\frac{MSS_{among} - MSS_{within}}{m} \n$$\n\nand \n\n$$\ns^{2}_{within} = MSS_{within} \n$$\n\n## Example\n\nLetâ€™s say you are taking photographs of your specimens. They are rather rounded and so it is hard to place them flat on the table to photograph from above. Issue 1 here is whether the shape variation we observe in the photo is real or due to placing the specimen at slightly different angles. Then, when once you have the photograph you need to digitize the landmarks. Issue 2 is whether you put the landmarks in the same place every time (i.e. is your criteria for the landmark robust enough that its obvious where it should be placed on each specimen, and if you came back to the data a month or year later?)\n\nTo assess measurement error in this instance we could take two sets of pictures, each time removing and positioning the specimen. And we could digitize each image twice, preferably in different sessions (another day or week). This would give us 4 sets of landmark data for each specimen, allowing us to asses both error associated with the digitization as well as error in capturing the shapes via the photographs. \n\nAlternatively, if we were interested in inter-observer error vs. repeatability within observer, we could take one photograph and have it measured by two different people, each person taking two sets of measurements (preferably in different sessions). \n\n### Simulated example:\n\nRepeat a set of five measurements, (measure twice), once in each of two sessions on different days.  How repeatable are the measurements?  \n\nSimulate the data:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrue_m <- rnorm(5,20,3)  # true values\nm1 <- true_m + rnorm(5,0,1) # measurements set 1\nm2 <- true_m + rnorm(5,0,1)\nsession <- gl(2, 5)\nindividual <- as.factor(rep(1:5,2))\ntotal_m <- c(m1, m2)\ncbind(individual, total_m, session)  # the data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      individual   total_m session\n [1,]          1 17.356495       1\n [2,]          2 10.402577       1\n [3,]          3 20.863459       1\n [4,]          4 21.638286       1\n [5,]          5 17.830617       1\n [6,]          1 18.276896       2\n [7,]          2  9.836041       2\n [8,]          3 19.419194       2\n [9,]          4 22.360297       2\n[10,]          5 16.256626       2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(aov(total_m ~ session))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nsession      1   0.38   0.377   0.018  0.896\nResiduals    8 166.70  20.837               \n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThere is no difference between sessions (yay)!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod <- summary(aov(total_m ~ individual))\nmod \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    \nindividual   4 163.95   40.99   65.55 0.000165 ***\nResiduals    5   3.13    0.63                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe specimens measured (individuals) are significantly different. \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ns2within <- MSwithin <- mod[[1]][2,3]\nMSamong <- mod[[1]][1,3]\ns2among <- (MSamong-MSwithin)/2\npME <- s2within/(s2within+s2among)*100\npME\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3.005222\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAnd the percent measurement error is represented by `pME`.  As a rough rule of thumb we want this to be less than 5%.  If it is very high, we either want to practice more, or take multiple measurements of each variable and average them. \n\n# Calculating morphometric parameters\n\nYour raw data may be in lengths for linear morphometrics or coordinate for landmark-based morphometrics. You will often have to calcuate quantities from your raw data such as distances and angles. \n\n## Calculating distances \n\nYou may need to calculate distances between your landmarks, or you may have species centroids (the means in multiple dimensions), and you want to know the distance between species in morphospace. \n\nThe distance between two points (in k dimensions) is given by the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the points.   \n\n$$\nd_{AB} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}} (A_i - B_i)^2  \n$$\n\nThis is analogous to calcuating the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle. If there is more than one dimension, these squared differences are computed dimension by dimension, summed, then the entire quantity is square rooted.\n\nA 2-D example in R is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA <- c(1,4)\nB <- c(6,8)\nplot( c(A[1], B[1]),c(A[2], B[2]), xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10), \n      xlab=\"X\", ylab=\"Y\", cex=4,  pch=16, col=\"red\")\nlines( c(A[1], B[1]),c(A[2], B[2]), lty=2, col=\"red\" )\nlines( c(A[1], B[1]),c(A[2], A[2]), col=\"grey\" )\nlines( c(B[1], B[1]),c(A[2], B[2]), col=\"grey\" )\ntext(A[1], A[2], \"A\")\ntext(B[1], B[2], \"B\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCompute the distance: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nA-B\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -5 -4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum((A-B)^2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 41\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(sum((A-B)^2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6.403124\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can create a function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndistance <- function( A, B ) { sqrt(sum((A-B)^2)) }\ndistance( A, B )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6.403124\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTry it on a 3-D set of coordinates. Does it work? \n\n## Angle between two vectors\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between two vectors $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{CD}$ can be calculated using the dot product and the rule of cosines. \n\nSuppose we have two vectors $V_1 = (x_1,y_1)$, and $V2 = (x_2,y_2)$. We can use our coordinates A, B above to calculate our first vector, and make up a second one. From geometry, we can think of vectors as originating at `(0,0)` with the vector coordinates indicating the head of the vector. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nV1 <- AB <- B - A  # using our A,B landmarks above\nV1 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5 4\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nV2 <- c(2,4)  # another vector\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dot product is then:\n\n$$\nV_1V_2 = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = |V_1| \\cdot |V_2| cos(\\theta)\n$$\n\nRearranging: \n\n$$\ncos(\\theta) = \\frac{ x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 } { |V_1| \\cdot |V_2| }\n$$\n\nAlso \n$$\n|V_1| = \\sqrt{  x_1^2 + y_1^2}\n$$\n\nAnd similarly for $V_2$.\n\nSo all we have to do is take the inverse cosine, arc cosine, or `acos()` to solve for the angle theta ($\\theta$).\n\n### Calculating the angle in R \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nV1 %*% V2  # the dot product. what is the difference with V1 * V2?\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     [,1]\n[1,]   26\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n           # same as sum(V1*V2) \n\ntheta <- acos( (V1 %*% V2) / (sqrt( V1%*%V1) * sqrt(V2%*%V2)) )\ntheta\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          [,1]\n[1,] 0.4324078\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhere the result is in radians, not degrees. \n\nNote: I should change this to using the arc tangent, to preserve the angle in case it is outside of 0,pi.\n\nTo covert to degrees, remember that a 360 degree circle is 2pi radians (or 180 degrees is 1pi radians): \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntheta_degrees <- theta/ pi * 180\ntheta_degrees\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         [,1]\n[1,] 24.77514\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Landmarks and Pseudolandmarks\n\n![Rodent lower jaw (mandible)](../../images/rodentmandible.jpg)\n[Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.7557)\n\nAcquiring landmarks usually involves some digitizing by hand. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#require(imager)  # install if you need to\n\n#jaw <- load.image(\"../../images/rodentmandible.jpg\")\n#plot(jaw)\n```\n:::\n",
