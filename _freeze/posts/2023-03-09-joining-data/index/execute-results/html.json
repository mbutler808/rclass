One common issue is that people sometimes use column names to store data. For example take a look at this built-in dataset that comes with `tidyr` on **religion and income survey data** with the number of respondents with income range in column name.\n\n\n# Joining data (a.k.a. Merging)\n\n## Relational data\n\nData analyses rarely involve only a single table of data.\n\nTypically you have many tables of data, and you **must combine the datasets** to answer the questions that you are interested in.  Some examples include morphology and ecology data on the same species, or sequence data and metadata. \n\nCollectively, **multiple tables of data are called relational data** because it is the *relations*, not just the individual datasets, that are important.\n\nRelations are **always defined between a pair of tables**. All other relations are built up from this simple idea: the relations of three or more tables are always a property of the relations between each pair.\n\nSometimes both elements of a pair can be in the same table! This is needed if, for example, you have a table of people, and each person has a reference to their parents, or if you have nodes in a phylogeny and each is linked to an ancestral node.\n\nRelational data are combined with **merges or joins**.\n\n## Example with `merge()`\n\nLetʻs use the `geospiza` data from the `geiger` package to practice merging with the base R `merge()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(geiger)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: geiger\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: ape\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(geospiza)   # load the dataset into the workspace\nls()               # list the objects in the workspace\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"geospiza\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngeospiza\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$geospiza.tree\n\nPhylogenetic tree with 14 tips and 13 internal nodes.\n\nTip labels:\n  fuliginosa, fortis, magnirostris, conirostris, scandens, difficilis, ...\n\nRooted; includes branch lengths.\n\n$geospiza.data\n                wingL  tarsusL  culmenL    beakD   gonysW\nmagnirostris 4.404200 3.038950 2.724667 2.823767 2.675983\nconirostris  4.349867 2.984200 2.654400 2.513800 2.360167\ndifficilis   4.224067 2.898917 2.277183 2.011100 1.929983\nscandens     4.261222 2.929033 2.621789 2.144700 2.036944\nfortis       4.244008 2.894717 2.407025 2.362658 2.221867\nfuliginosa   4.132957 2.806514 2.094971 1.941157 1.845379\npallida      4.265425 3.089450 2.430250 2.016350 1.949125\nfusca        3.975393 2.936536 2.051843 1.191264 1.401186\nparvulus     4.131600 2.973060 1.974420 1.873540 1.813340\npauper       4.232500 3.035900 2.187000 2.073400 1.962100\nPinaroloxias 4.188600 2.980200 2.311100 1.547500 1.630100\nPlatyspiza   4.419686 3.270543 2.331471 2.347471 2.282443\npsittacula   4.235020 3.049120 2.259640 2.230040 2.073940\n\n$phy\n\nPhylogenetic tree with 14 tips and 13 internal nodes.\n\nTip labels:\n  fuliginosa, fortis, magnirostris, conirostris, scandens, difficilis, ...\n\nRooted; includes branch lengths.\n\n$dat\n                wingL  tarsusL  culmenL    beakD   gonysW\nmagnirostris 4.404200 3.038950 2.724667 2.823767 2.675983\nconirostris  4.349867 2.984200 2.654400 2.513800 2.360167\ndifficilis   4.224067 2.898917 2.277183 2.011100 1.929983\nscandens     4.261222 2.929033 2.621789 2.144700 2.036944\nfortis       4.244008 2.894717 2.407025 2.362658 2.221867\nfuliginosa   4.132957 2.806514 2.094971 1.941157 1.845379\npallida      4.265425 3.089450 2.430250 2.016350 1.949125\nfusca        3.975393 2.936536 2.051843 1.191264 1.401186\nparvulus     4.131600 2.973060 1.974420 1.873540 1.813340\npauper       4.232500 3.035900 2.187000 2.073400 1.962100\nPinaroloxias 4.188600 2.980200 2.311100 1.547500 1.630100\nPlatyspiza   4.419686 3.270543 2.331471 2.347471 2.282443\npsittacula   4.235020 3.049120 2.259640 2.230040 2.073940\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngeo <- geospiza$dat  # save the morphometric data as geo\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is a 5 column dataframe.

It mutates because it adds on. A mutating join **combines variables from two tables**. It first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one table to the other on the right side of the table (similar to `mutate()`). \n    -   See @sec-mutjoins for Table of mutating joins.\n-   [**Filtering joins**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#filtering-joins): Filtering joins **match observations** in the same way as mutating joins, **but select the observations that match** (not the variables). In other words, this type of join filters observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other.\n    -   Two types: `semi_join(x, y)` and `anti_join(x, y)`.\n-   [**Set operations**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html#set-operations): Treat **observations as if they were set elements**. Typically used less frequently, but occasionally useful when you want to break a single complex filter into simpler pieces. All these operations work with a complete row, comparing the values of every variable. These expect the x and y inputs to have the same variables, and treat the observations like sets:\n    -   Examples of set operations: `intersect(x, y)`, `union(x, y)`, and `setdiff(x, y)`.\n:::\n\n## Keys\n\nThe **variables used to connect each pair of tables** are called **keys**. A key is a variable (or set of variables) that __uniquely identifies an observation__. In simple cases, a single variable is sufficient to identify an observation.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Note\n\nThere are two types of keys:\n\n-   A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table.\n-   A **foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table.\n:::\n\nLet's consider an example to help us understand the difference between a **primary key** and **foreign key**.\n\n## Example of keys\n\nImagine you are conduct a study and **collecting data on subjects and a health outcome**.\n\nOften, subjects will **have multiple observations** (a longitudinal study). Similarly, we may record other information, such as the type of housing.\n\n### The first table\n\nThis code creates a simple table with some made up data about some hypothetical subjects' outcomes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\noutcomes <- tibble(\n        id = rep(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"), each = 3),\n        visit = rep(0:2, 3),\n        outcome = rnorm(3 * 3, 3)\n)\n\nprint(outcomes)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  id    visit outcome\n  <chr> <int>   <dbl>\n1 a         0    1.81\n2 a         1    3.09\n3 a         2    3.44\n4 b         0    2.77\n5 b         1    3.37\n6 b         2    1.97\n7 c         0    3.69\n8 c         1    3.28\n9 c         2    2.05\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that subjects are labeled by a unique identifer in the `id` column.\n\n### A second table\n\nHere is some code to create a second table containing  data about the hypothetical subjects' housing type.\n\n\n::: {.cell exercise='true'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubjects <- tibble(\n        id = c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"),\n        house = c(\"detached\", \"rowhouse\", \"rowhouse\")\n)\n\nprint(subjects)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  id    house   \n  <chr> <chr>   \n1 a     detached\n2 b     rowhouse\n3 c     rowhouse\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n### Question\n\nWhat is the **primary key** and **foreign key**?\n\n-   The `outcomes$id` is a **primary key** because it uniquely identifies each subject in the `outcomes` table.\n-   The `subjects$id` is a **foreign key** because it appears in the `subjects` table where it matches each subject to a unique `id`.\n:::\n\n# Mutating joins {#sec-mutjoins}\n\nThe `dplyr` package provides a set of **functions for joining two data frames** into a single data frame based on a set of key columns.\n\nThere are several functions in the `*_join()` family.\n\n-   These functions all merge together two data frames\n-   They differ in how they handle observations that exist in one but not both data frames.\n\nHere, are the **four functions from this family** that you will likely use the most often:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Function       |What it includes in merged data frame                                                                     |\n|:--------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|`left_join()`  |Includes all observations in the left data frame, whether or not there is a match in the right data frame |\n|`right_join()` |Includes all observations in the right data frame, whether or not there is a match in the left data frame |\n|`inner_join()` |Includes only observations that are in both data frames                                                   |\n|`full_join()`  |Includes all observations from both data frames                                                           |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png)\n\n\\[[Source from R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data#relational-data)\\]\n\n\n\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  Using prose, describe how the variables and observations are organised in a tidy dataset versus an non-tidy dataset.\n\n2.  What do the extra and fill arguments do in `separate()`? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(x = c(\"a,b,c\", \"d,e,f,g\", \"h,i,j\")) %>% \n  separate(x, c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"))\n\ntibble(x = c(\"a,b,c\", \"d,e\", \"f,g,i\")) %>% \n  separate(x, c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n3.  Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a remove argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to FALSE?\n\n4.  Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`. Why are there three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with groups), but only one `unite()`?\n:::\n\n\n\n",
