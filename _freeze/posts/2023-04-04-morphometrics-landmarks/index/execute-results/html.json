This works well for many questions, especially ones that relate to lever mechanics, such as locomotion or bite force, etc. but does not capture 3D variation well such as the geometric shape of a skull or the details of seed shape.  \n\n__Geometric morphometrics__ aims to characterize more complex shapes by the use of __landmarks__, locations on the specimens determined by the researcher to reveal key insights or capture the full range of variation. \n\n\nIn order to do this, we still need methods to characterize __size__ vs. __shape__. For geometric morphometrics that is typically __Procrustes superposition__. Some other differences also involve the data. Whereas one can typically take linear measurements directly on the specimen (with calipers or a ruler), collecting landmark data usually involves some image capture. \n\n# Capturing images\n\nThe most important thing is consistency and a protocol that minimizes error. While the specific protocol will vary by the type of object and technology (cameras, uCT, etc.), some general principles are :\n\n- Specimen Layout \n  + Be as __consistent__ as possible in the preparation of specimens and their arrangement\n  + Place every specimen on the same side. (Capture the same aspect of each specimen)\n  + Same pose or posture\n  + Mouths open? Closed?\n  + Fins or dewlaps exposed to show shape and articulatio, etc. \n- Size and Metadata\n  - Include a size standard (e.g., a ruler), ideally the same item, with X-Y information\n  - Include the specimen ID in the photo itself (written on a card, etc.) \n- Camera\n  - Camera in same position and same angle, preferably with a tripod\n  - Use the same camera and lens (or zoom, etc.)\n  - Make several backups (multiple flash cards, save to computer, etc.)\n  - Specimen perpendicular to camera (check level)\n  - Same lighting\n  - Take several photos as backup\n- Data Management\n  - Keep a notebook (written log) of the specimens being photographed, in order\n  - Transfer files to raw data folder for photos (in same format and same order)\n  - Name files with metadata in filenames for each specimen, save in another folder \n  - You should have Raw_Photos, Named_Photos folders.  \n\nErrors and distortions can be fixed with software, but it is much easier to minimize them at the start. \n\n# Landmarks \n\nEssential features of good landmarks:\n\nChoose landmarks that are:  \n\n-  Present on all specimens  \n-  Relevant to the question  \n-  Clearly defined (to be repeatable)  \n-  Conform to accepted best practices for your type of study (do a literature search)  \n\nHere is an example of typical landmarks:\n\n![Rodent lower jaw (mandible).

For 2D landmark data the workflow is:\n\n-  Read in the image file  \n-  Set the scale   \n-  Digitize landmarks, collecting X-Y coordinate data \n\nImage files are rows and columns of pixels, the number of which is determined by the file size and resolution. Pixels therefore, form a grid which we can digitize, meaning we can indicate at which pixel our landmark of interest is. We translate the pixel coordinates into real-world distances, typically by ditigizing an object of known dimensions such as a ruler. Digitizing software typically asks the user to indicate the points on the screen and the known distances they correspond to. \n\nEasy-to use software for this purpose include `ImageJ` and `FIJI`, as well as the `geomorph` package in R.  Before doing a large project, I would try them all to see which serves your purpose the best. \n\n\n#  `geomorph` package\n\nThe package `geomorph` is widely used for geometric morphometrics, and will serve as a good example to illustrate the geometric morphometrics workflow all in R (depending on the project and the material, however, you may find it more convenient or efficient to use other software for digitizing).   \n\n\n### Digitizing landmarks in `geomorph`\n\n\nFor a quick example, letʻs do a 2D landmark collection on the Red Fox Mandible using `digitize2d()`.  Emma Sherratʻs [quick guide to Geomorph](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre-Palaoro/post/Geomorph-Package-in-R/attachment/5cffb777cfe4a7968da98557/AS%3A768610867900420%401560262519604/download/Quick_Guide_to_Geomorph-3.0.pdf) provides a more thorough walk-through for capturing landmarks in Chapter 15.  \n\n\nThe syntax for `digitize2d()` is:\n\n`digitize2d(filelist, nlandmarks, scale = NULL, tpsfile, verbose = TRUE)`\n\nWhere:\n\n-  `filelist` : a vector of filenames of image files\n-  `nlandmarks` : the number of landmarks to digitize  \n-  `scale`  : the length of scale to use (optional)  \n-  `tpsfile` : the name of an output file to create or read \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrequire(geomorph)\n\nfiles <- c(\"red-fox-mandible-lateral.jpg\")\n# files <- list.files(pattern = \"*.jpg\") \n             # for multiple files in your image directory\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndigitize2d( files, \n            nlandmarks=10, \n            scale=80, \n            tpsfile = \"mandible-lat.tps\", \n            verbose = TRUE) \n```\n:::\n\n\nR will now wait for you to digitize the first landmark. In verbose mode, it will ask you to _confirm_ each landmark (this can be turned off). If a landmark is missing, choose `a` for absent. If you make a mistake and choose `n`, it will ask you to redigitize it. The output will be sent to a `.tps `file.\n\n\n# TPS format\n\nTPS format is a standard morphometric data format for storing landmark coordinate data. \n\n`readland.tps()` reads TPS format and returns an array: _p_ landmarks by _k_ dimensions by _N_ specimens.  \n\nRemember an array is simply a multidimensional dataframe. Think of it here as a stack of spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet has rows for landmarks and columns for dimensions.  We have a separate spreadsheet for each specimen, making this a 3-dimensional array. \n\nThe third dimension of this array contains names for each specimen, which are obtained from the image names in the _.tps_ file.  We can read in the data that we digitized above:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- readland.tps(\"mandible-lat.tps\", specID = \"ID\", readcurves = FALSE, warnmsg = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nNo curves detected; all points appear to be fixed landmarks.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n, , ../../images/red-fox-mandible-lateral.jpg\n\n           [,1]      [,2]\n [1,] 107.29125 109.47242\n [2,] 103.69036 108.94577\n [3,] 101.66872 108.37825\n [4,]  43.63469 105.62467\n [5,]  10.59532 111.73118\n [6,]  16.56440 102.17078\n [7,]  12.09659  98.37737\n [8,]  34.05770  93.06904\n [9,]  66.20128  89.99578\n[10,] 113.50334 107.91870\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the name saved with the data in this case was the file name.

In addition, sometimes curves and surfaces have no distinct feature that can be reliably captured as the same homologous point from specimen to specimen. For example, the curvature of a smooth shell may lack any distinct landmarks. In both of these cases, semi-landmarks can be helpful. \n\n__Semi-landmarks__ are regularly spaced points between two landmarks or along a curve or a surface.   \n  __Sliding semi-landmarks__ are spaced linearly along a curve.  \n  __Surface semi-landmarks__ are spread out evenly in 3D along a surface. \n\nNOTE: One thing to note is that any error in the landmarks will also be propagated to the semilandmarks. \n\n![Figure: Landmark and semilandmark data displayed on the caecilian _Siphonops annulatus_ BMNH 1956.1.15.88.
