# Overview

# Morphometric Workflow

::: {.callout-tip}
## Typical Morphometric Worflow
-  Ask interesting question, develop hypotheses, collect specimens
-  Take photos/images of the specimens
-  Place landmarks on the specimens in the photos at key locations. Choose landmarks that are:
  +  Present on all specimens
  +  Relevant to question
  +  Clearly defined
-  Analyze how the landmarks vary in relation to each other among specimens
-  Perform statistical analyses to test for significant differences in body shape among
populations, species, or whatever aspect that is relevant to your hypotheses
-  Plot components of variation in shape that are not correlated with each other (i.e. the principal component scores).

# Types of Questions that Morphometrics can Answer (not exhaustive)

1. Relationship of parts to other parts. 
2. Allometry - relationship of shape to size
3. Comparison among groups
4. Covariation of shape with other factors
5. Covariation of morphology with phylogeny
6. Morpholgical integration 
7. Modularity
