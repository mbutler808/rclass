# Introduction to git/GitHub

This document gives a brief explanation of GitHub and how we will use it for this course.

## git

**Git** is software that implements what is called a *version control system* for a repository of files (also known as a *repo*). The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.

**GitHub** is an online server and user interface that also provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.

**Git** and **GitHub** together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.

```
\[[Source: Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/)]

It is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel [pretty interesting interview with Torvalds](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds). What it did really well was *distributed control*, and allowing everyone to have their *own copy of the repository*.

*Git*/*GitHub* is now the dominant version control system with *GitHub* hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.

Another great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by [Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).

## What to (not) use Git/GitHub for

**GitHub is ideal if** you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.

**GitHub is less useful if** you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.

**GitHub also has a problem with *large files***. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. *This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file.* Therefore keep large (>50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.

**Finally, if you have *data***, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories (the GitHub name for your projects) are public and everyone can see them. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data enough that it is not at risk of identifiability, then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it public, be very careful that you only make things public that are ok to be made public.


::: callout-tip
-   Git/GitHub has version control features like a turbo-charged version of "track changes" but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files
-   Great for solo or collaborative work
-   Saves the entire history of every change made
-   Allows for multiple verisions or "branches" to be developed and later merged
-   GitHub allows distributed collaboration (potentially among complete strangers) and has greatly promoted open-source software development, collaboration, distribution, and bug/issue tracking for users to get help
-   GitHub allows *webpages* for your projects or repositories

:::

Note that other interfaces to *Git* exist, e.g., *Bitbucket*, but *GitHub* is the most widely used one.

## Why use git/GitHub?

You want to use *GitHub* to avoid this:

To learn a bit more about Git/GitHub and why you might want to use it, [read this article by Jenny Bryan](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).

**Note her explanation of what's special with the `README.md` file on GitHub.**

## How to use Git/GitHub

Git/GitHub is fundamentally **based on commands you type into the command line**. Lots of online resources show you how to use the command line. This is the most powerful, and the way I almost always interact with git/GitHub. However, many folks find this the most confusing way to use git/GitHub. Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.

-   [GitHub itself](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.
-   RStudio also has [Git/GitHub integration](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.
-   There are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won't need initially, but might eventually.

**Note**: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e. access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) on how to do this.

# Getting Started with git

One of my favorite resources for getting started with git/GitHub is the Happy Git with R from Jenny Bryan:

-   <https://happygitwithr.com>

It truly is one of the **best resources** out there for getting started with git/GitHub, especially with the integration to RStudio. Therefore, at this point, I will encourage all of you to go read through the online book.

Some of you may only need to skim it, others will need to spend some time reading through it. Either way, I will bet that you won't regret the time investment.

## Set up your profile in git on your computer

At some point you may want to make changes to your repository. Of course before GitHub allows anyone to make changes to your data, they will want to verify your identity (of course!)

In order for your computer to talk to GitHub smoothly, you will need to set up your username and email in the git profile stored on your computer. **Be sure to match** whatever username and email you used to setup your GitHub account. Easy directions are provided here <https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html>

## Set up your Personal Authentication Token on your computer

In addition to GitHub knowing who you are, they will want some credentials to authenticate you are really you. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is the protocol for HTTP authentication. You will generate a personal access token for HTTPS from your GitHub account which will be stored on your personal machine. It is explained nicely here <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html>

 You only have to do it once for each computer, then you can push and pull from GitHub to your heartʻs content. It really is a nice way to do things securely.


# Using git/GitHub in our course

In this course, you will use git/GitHub in the following ways:

1.  Project 0 (optional) - You will create a website introducing yourself to folks in the course and deploy it on GitHub.
2.  Projects 1-4 - You can practice using git locally (on your compute environment) to track your changes over time and, if you wish (but highly suggested), you can practice pushing your project solutions to a private GitHub repository on your GitHub account (i.e. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, etc) .

Learning these skills will be useful down the road if you ever work collaboratively on a project (i.e. writing code as a group). In this scenario, you will use the skills you have been practicing in your projects to work together as a team in a single GitHub repository.

# Clone a repo to your local directory - Easy!

Cloning an existing repo from GitHub is easy. Letʻs clone the **rclassdata** repo to our local git folder within your Documents folder.
1. Go to <https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata> and click on the green **<>Code** button and copy the URL.
```{r}
#| label: github_cloning.png
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: 'Cloning from an existing repo'
#| out-width: '100%'
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/github_cloning.png")
```

2. In your Terminal or CMD prompt, navigate to your git folder (create one in Documents if you donʻt have one already), and clone the repo:
```{.bash filename=Terminal}
pwd  # or dir on PC
cd ~/Documents/git  # navigate to your git folder
git clone https://github.com/mbutler808/rclassdata.git
```
If you set up your personal access token, it should appear on your computer! [If not, set it up following these instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)

# Make a GitHub repo started from your local files

Suppose you have some files on your computer and youʻd like to make them into a repo.  For this example, weʻre going to make a repo called **test**

1. Create a folder in your `Documents/git` directory called `test` and copy some files there.
2. Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Click on the small black + on the top right corner
```{r}
#| label: github_new
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: 'Create a new repo button'
#| out-width: '50%'
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/git_newrepo.png")
```

3. Give your new repo a name ("test") and choose to create a blank repo with no README.md or .gitignore. We can add them later.
```{r}
#| label: github_create_new_repo.png
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: 'Set up a blank repo'
#| out-width: '100%'
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/git_create_new_repo.png")
```

4. You will see the following page giving you helpful hints for linking your GitHub repo with your local repo. We will follow the first set of instructions, slightly modified.
```{r}
#| label: github_quicksetup.png
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '100%'
knitr::include_graphics("../../images/github_quicksetup.png")
```

Explantations for each line of code:

- `echo "# test" >> README.md`  Write `# test` to `README.md` which will be created since it doesnʻt already exist
- `git init`  Intializes the local repo to set up git tracking (only need to to this once)
- `git add .` Adds (. = all) our files and commits any changes to the repo
- `git commit -m "first commit"`  Commit message
- `git branch -M main` Renames the local branch to main
- `git remote add origin URL` Connect the remote repo (="origin" on GitHub) to our local repo. Be sure to copy the appropriate URL for your own GitHub repo.
- `git push -u origin main` Push our local changes (in main) up to the remote (to a parallel branch main on origin).


```{.bash filename=Terminal}
echo "# test" >> README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/mbutler808/test.git
git push -u origin main
```

# GitHub requires authentication to overwrite your repository (this is a good thing `r emojifont::emoji('smiley')``r emojifont::emoji('+1')`)

- Did *GitHub* complain that it doesnʻt know your **username** or **email**?

This might be because the default info on your computer doesnʻt match what you used to register for your GitHub account. Not to worry, just set it to match your GitHub account here: <https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html>

- Did *GitHub* complain that your **authentication** failed?

Donʻt worry, you can set up your personal access token (I recommend the HTTPS protocol): <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html> Nice bonus, you only have to do it once for each computer.

5. Check your remote repo. The files from your computer should be there!
6. Now try pushing up another change. Make some edit to one or more local files.
7. Add, Commit, Push:
```{.bash filename=Terminal}
git add .
git commit -m "made a small change"
git push origin main
```
Check your remote repo. Did it go up? Well done! `r emojifont::emoji('heart_eyes')`

Your local files and your GitHub repository files are now synced!

# A word about merge conflicts

Sooner or later, you will encounter a merge conflict. That happens if the same file(s) changed both locally and on GitHub.com. That can happen if multiple people work on the same files, or if you work on multiple computers and forget to always push/pull before and after you work on a project. Donʻt get discouraged, this is solvable!

Sometimes you have to do it manually. Moving the offending files out of your local repository, then doing the merge and after that adding the updates again can help. If you know that one source is the definite one, you can force a push or pull. A more advanced approach is to use branches.

```{.bash filename=Terminal}
git push --force
```

::: callout-warning
- The main danger is that a force push or pull will force git to write over a conflict, and can possibly destroy someone elseʻs work. If youʻre the only one on the repo, then itʻs only your changes that youʻll lose
- Just be aware but donʻt be afraid to practice. You can always revert back.
- See the help page for [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push). See the -f or --force flag. Itʻs terse computer help, but if you make the effort it will start to make sense.
- Iʻll link a more tutorial type resource later
