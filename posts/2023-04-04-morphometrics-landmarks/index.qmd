# Overview

__Traditional morphometrics__ uses linear measurements such as body length, hind limb length, etc. to characterize morphological variation. This works well for many questions, especially ones that relate to lever mechanics, such as locomotion or bite force, etc. but does not capture 3D variation well such as the geometric shape of a skull or the details of seed shape.  

__Geometric morphometrics__ aims to characterize more complex shapes by the use of __landmarks__, locations on the specimens determined by the researcher to reveal key insights or capture the full range of variation. 


In order to do this, we still need methods to characterize __size__ vs. __shape__. For geometric morphometrics that is typically __Procrustes superposition__. Some other differences also involve the data. Whereas one can typically take linear measurements directly on the specimen (with calipers or a ruler), collecting landmark data usually involves some image capture. 

# Capturing images

The most important thing is consistency and a protocol that minimizes error. While the specific protocol will vary by the type of object and technology (cameras, uCT, etc.), some general principles are :

- Specimen Layout 
  + Be as __consistent__ as possible in the preparation of specimens and their arrangement
  + Place every specimen on the same side. (Capture the same aspect of each specimen)
  + Same pose or posture
  + Mouths open? Closed?
  + Fins or dewlaps exposed to show shape and articulatio, etc. 
- Size and Metadata
  - Include a size standard (e.g., a ruler), ideally the same item, with X-Y information
  - Include the specimen ID in the photo itself (written on a card, etc.) 
- Camera
  - Camera in same position and same angle, preferably with a tripod
  - Use the same camera and lens (or zoom, etc.)
  - Make several backups (multiple flash cards, save to computer, etc.)
  - Specimen perpendicular to camera (check level)
  - Same lighting
  - Take several photos as backup
- Data Management
  - Keep a notebook (written log) of the specimens being photographed, in order
  - Transfer files to raw data folder for photos (in same format and same order)
  - Name files with metadata in filenames for each specimen, save in another folder 
  - You should have Raw_Photos, Named_Photos folders.  

Errors and distortions can be fixed with software, but it is much easier to minimize them at the start. 

# Landmarks and Pseudolandmarks

Essential features of good landmarks:

Choose landmarks that are:  

-  Present on all specimens  
-  Relevant to the question  
-  Clearly defined (to be repeatable)  
-  Conform to accepted best practices for your type of study (do a literature search)  

Here is an example of typical landmarks:

Acquiring landmarks usually involves some digitizing by hand (with computer assistance). For 2D landmark data:

-  Read in the image file  
-  Set the scale (translation between pixels and known distance)  
-  Digitize landmarks, collecting X-Y coordinate data 

Easy-to use software for this purpose include `ImageJ` and `FIJI`, as well as the `geomorph` package in R.  Before doing a large project, I would try them all to see which serves your purpose the best. 

For `geomorph`, Emma Sherratʻs [Emma Sherratʻs quick guide to Geomorph](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexandre-Palaoro/post/Geomorph-Package-in-R/attachment/5cffb777cfe4a7968da98557/AS%3A768610867900420%401560262519604/download/Quick_Guide_to_Geomorph-3.0.pdf) provides an excellent walk-through in Chapter 15.  

For a quick example, letʻs do a 2D landmark collection on the Red Fox Mandible using `digitize2d()`. 

The syntax is:

`digitize2d(filelist, nlandmarks, scale = NULL, tpsfile, verbose = TRUE)`

Where:

`filelist` : vector of filenames.  
`nlandmarks` : number of landmarks to digitize
`scale`  : length of scale to use (optional)
`tpsfile` : name of output file to create or read (to edit)

```{r}
#| warning: false
require(geomorph)

files <- c("red-fox-mandible-lateral.jpg")
# files <- list.files(pattern = "*.jpg") # for multiple files in your image directory
```
```{r}
#| eval: false
digitize2d( files, 
            nlandmarks=10, 
            scale=80, 
            tpsfile = "mandible-lat.tps", 
            verbose = TRUE) 
```

In verbose mode, it will ask you to confirm each landmark (this can be turned off). If a landmark is missing, choose `a` for absent. Make a mistake and choose `n` - it will ask you to redigitize it. 

The output will be sent to the tps file:

```{r}
dat <- readland.tps("mandible-lat.tps", specID = "ID", readcurves = FALSE, warnmsg = TRUE)
dat
```

For another example, check out the `plethodon` data included with `geomorph`

```{r}
data(plethodon)
attributes(plethodon)
str(plethodon)
```

3D coordinates in tps format contain 3D arrays (one table per specimen).

# Semi-Landmarks

Oftentimes, there is more shape variation than distinct landmarks. For example, there is no distinct landmark that you can reliable digitize on the curve of a shell, for example. In this case, semi-landmarks can be helpful. 

__Semi-landmarks__ are regularly spaced points between two landmarks or along a curve or a surface.   
  __Sliding semi-landmarks__ are spaced linearly along a curve.  
  __Surface semi-landmarks__ are spread out evenly in 3D along a surface. 

NOTE: One thing to note is that any error in the landmarks will also be propagated through the semilandmarks.
