## Learning R - A first session

::: {.incremental}
- Think about how R works as you try out commands
- <https://www.r-project.org>  Go to manuals, click on **An Introduction to R**
- Follow Section 2.1
- input -> R -> output
- What came out? What does it tell you about the rules R follows?
- Computers only do **Exactly** what you tell them to do
- Jump to Appendix A - letʻs try to understand some rules of R together
:::

## Goals

- Creativity
- Accuracy
- Authority
- Repeatability
- Communication
  + Ease of dissemination to other researchers
  + Show me, donʻt tell me

## Tools

::: {.incremental}
- Our senses
- Notebooks and Pens
- Excel
- Command Line (UNIX/ Windows/ File Commands in your operating system)
- R
- Git/GitHub
- Quarto/Rmarkdown
