After all, isnʻt that what the methods section is for? We are taught to write methods sections so that any scientist could, in theory, repeat the experiment with the idea that if the phenomenon is true, they should obtain comparable results and more often than not should come to the same conclusions.\nBut how repeatable is modern science? Many experiments are now so complex and so expensive that repeating them is not practical. However, it is even worse than that. As datasets get larger and analyses become ever more complex, there is a growing concern that even given the data, we still cannot necessarily repeat the analysis. This is called “the reproducbility crisis”.\nRecently, there has been a lot of discussion of reproducibility in the media and in the scientific literature. The journal Science had a special issue on reproducibility and data replication.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/toc/science/334/6060\n\nTake for example a recent study by the Crowdsourced Replication Initiative (2022). It was a massive effort by 166 coauthors published in PNAS to test repeatability:\n\n73 research teams from around the world analyzed the same social science data.\nThey investigated the same hypothesis: that more immigration will reduce public support for government provision of social policies.\nTogether they fit 1261 statistical models and came to widely varying concluisons.\nA meta-analysis of the results by the PIs could not explain the variation in results. Even after accounting for the choices made by the research teams in designing their statistical tests, 95% of the total variation remained unexplained.\nThe authors claim that “a hidden universe of uncertainty remains.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Breznau et al., 2022\nThis should be very disturbing. It was very disturbing to me! Greyer notes that the meta-analysis did not investigate how much of the variability of results was due to outright error. He furthermore notes that while the meta-analysis was done in a reproducibly, the original 73 analyses were not. What does he mean?\n\n\nSome of the issues from a statisticianʻs perspective\nGreyer provides nine ideas worth considering:\n\nMost scientific papers that need statistics have conclusions that are not actually supported by the statistical calculations done, because of\n\nmathematical or computational error,\nstatistical procedures inappropriate for the data, or\nstatistical procedures that do not lead to the inferences claimed.\n\nGood computing practices — version control, well thought out testing, code reviews, literate programming — are essential to correct computing.\nFailure to do all calculations from raw data to conclusions (every number or figure shown in a paper) in a way that is fully reproducible and available in a permanent public repository is, by itself, a questionable research practice.\nFailure to do statistics as if it could have been pre-registered is a questionable research practice.\nJournals that use P < 0.05 as a criterion of publication are not scientific journals (publishing only one side of a story is as unscientific as it is possible to be).\nStatistics should be adequately described, at least in the supplementary material.\nScientific papers whose conclusions depend on nontrivial statistics should have statistical referees, and those referees should be heeded.\nNot all errors are describable by statistics. There is also what physicists call systematic error that is the same in every replication of an experiment. Physicists regularly attempt to quantify this. Others should too.\n\nA reasonable ideal for reproducible research today - Research should be reproducible. Anything in a scientific paper should be reproducible by the reader. - Whatever may have been the case in low tech days, this ideal has long gone. Much scientific research in recent years is too complicated and the published details to scanty for anyone to reproduce it. - The lack of detail is not entirely the author’s fault. Journals have severe page pressure and no room for full explanations. - For many years, the only hope of reproducibility is old-fashioned person-to-person contact. Write the authors, ask for data, code, whatever. Some authors help, some don’t. If the authors are not cooperative, tough. - Even cooperative authors may be unable to help. If too much time has gone by and their archiving was not systematic enough and if their software was unportable, there may be no way to recreate the analysis. - Fortunately, the internet comes to the rescue. No page pressure there! - Nowadays, many scientific papers also point to supplementary materials on the internet. Data, computer programs, whatever should be there, permanently. Ideally with a permanent Document Identifier or DOI. There are complaints that many Supplmentary Materials are incomprehensible, but that can be improved with practices of reproducible reserach.\nTherefore, at the very least scientists should use in their statistical programming - version control, - software testing, - code reviews, - literate programming, and - all data and code available in a permanent public repository.\nSome journals have specific policies to promote reproducibility in manuscripts that are published in their journals. For example, the Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA) requires authors to submit their code and data to reproduce their analyses and a set of Associate Editors of Reproducibility review those materials as part of the review process:\n\nhttps://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide\n\n\n\nRecommendations\nDiscuss Table 1\n\nAuthors and Readers\nIt is important to realize that there are multiple players when you talk about reproducibility–there are different types of parties that have different types of interests. There are authors who produce research and they want to make their research reproducible. There are also readers of research and they want to reproduce that work. Everyone needs tools to make their lives easier.\nOne current challenge is that authors of research have to undergo considerable effort to make their results available to a wide audience.\n\nPublishing data and code today is not necessarily a trivial task. Although there are a number of resources available now, that were not available even five years ago, it is still a bit of a challenge to get things out on the web (or at least distributed widely).\nResources like GitHub, kipoi, and RPubs and various data repositories have made a big difference, but there is still a ways to go with respect to building up the public reproducibility infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, even when data and code are available, readers often have to download the data, download the code, and then they have to piece everything together, usually by hand. It’s not always an easy task to put the data and code together.\n\nReaders may not have the same computational resources that the original authors did.\nIf the original authors used an enormous computing cluster, for example, to do their analysis, the readers may not have that same enormous computing cluster at their disposal. It may be difficult for readers to reproduce the same results.\n\nGenerally, the toolbox for doing reproducible research is small, although it’s definitely growing.\n\nIn practice, authors often just throw things up on the web. There are journals and supplementary materials, but they are famously disorganized.\nThere are only a few central databases that authors can take advantage of to post their data and make it available. So if you are working in a field that has a central database that everyone uses, that is great. If you are not, then you have to assemble your own resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\nThe process of conducting and disseminating research can be depicted as a “data science pipeline”\nReaders and consumers of data science research are typically not privy to the details of the data science pipeline\nOne view of reproducibility is that it gives research consumers partial access to the raw pipeline elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-lecture materials\n\nFinal Questions\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy can replication be difficult to achieve? Why is reproducibility a reasonable minimum standard when replication is not possible?\nWhat is needed to reproduce the results of a data analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility and Error by Charles J.

Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown\n\nThe R Markdown Cookbook by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, and Emily Riederer is really good too:\n\nhttps://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook\n\nThe authors of the 2nd book describe the motivation for the 2nd book as:\n\n“However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born.”\n\n\n\nBecause this is lecture is built in a .qmd file (which is very similar to a .Rmd file), let’s demonstrate how this work. I am going to change eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE.\n\ndata(airquality)\nplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Wind)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we not see the back ticks ``` anymore in the code chunk above that made the plot?\nWhat do you think we should do if we want to have the code executed, but we want to hide the code that made it?\n\n\n\nBefore we leave this section, I find that there is quite a bit of terminology to understand the magic behind rmarkdown that can be confusing, so let’s break it down:\n\nPandoc. Pandoc is a command line tool with no GUI that converts documents (e.g. from number of different markup formats to many other formats, such as .doc, .pdf etc). It is completely independent from R (but does come bundled with RStudio). If you donʻt have Rstudio installed, you will have to install pandoc.\nMarkdown (markup language). Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats. A markdown file is a plain text file that is typically given the extension .md. It is completely independent from R.\nR Markdown (markup language). R Markdown is an extension of the markdown syntax for weaving together text with R code. R Markdown files are plain text files that typically have the file extension .Rmd.\nrmarkdown (R package). The R package rmarkdown is a library that uses pandoc to process and convert text and R code written in .Rmd files into a number of different formats. This core function is rmarkdown::render(). Note: this package only deals with the markdown language. If the input file is e.g. .Rhtml or .Rnw, then you need to use knitr prior to calling pandoc (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCheck out the R Markdown Quick Tour for more:\n\nhttps://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by Allison Horst on RMarkdown\n\n\n\nknitr\nOne of the alternative that has come up in recent times is something called knitr.\n\nThe knitr package for R takes a lot of these ideas of literate programming and updates and improves upon them.\nknitr still uses R as its programming language, but it allows you to mix other programming languages in.\nYou can also use a variety of documentation languages now, such as LaTeX, markdown and HTML.\nknitr was developed by Yihui Xie while he was a graduate student at Iowa State and it has become a very popular package for writing literate statistical programs.\n\nKnitr takes a plain text document with embedded code, executes the code and ‘knits’ the results back into the document.\nFor for example, it converts\n\nAn R Markdown (.Rmd) file into a standard markdown file (.md)\nAn .Rnw (Sweave) file into to .tex format.\nAn .Rhtml file into to .html.\n\nThe core function is knitr::knit() and by default this will look at the input document and try and guess what type it is e.g. Rnw, Rmd etc.\nThis core function performs three roles:\n\nA source parser, which looks at the input document and detects which parts are code that the user wants to be evaluated.\nA code evaluator, which evaluates this code\nAn output renderer, which writes the results of evaluation back to the document in a format which is interpretable by the raw output type. For instance, if the input file is an .Rmd, the output render marks up the output of code evaluation in .md format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting a Rmd file to many outputs using knitr and pandoc\n\n\n\n\n[Source]\nAs seen in the figure above, from there pandoc is used to convert e.g. a .md file into many other types of file formats into a .html, etc.\nSo in summary:\n\n“R Markdown stands on the shoulders of knitr and Pandoc. The former executes the computer code embedded in Markdown, and converts R Markdown to Markdown. The latter renders Markdown to the output format you want (such as PDF, HTML, Word, and so on).”\n\n[Source]"

    "text": "Create your website locally with Quarto\nIn this section, I am adding a bit more explanation to the Quarto quickstart guide up to and including Render. If something is not clear, please consult https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\nThere are three main quarto commands we will use:\n\nquarto create-project: Make a website project template\nquarto preview: Take a look at what the webite will look like\nquarto render: Render your qmd to html\n\n\nMake your website directory and template\nCreate your website (here called mysite) using the following command. It will make a directory of the same name and put the website contents within it.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto create-project mysite --type website\n\nYou should now see the following files in your mysite directory (Figure 2):\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Website files from the Terminal view\n\n\nThis is the bare-bones version of your website. Check that the code is functional by looking at a preview:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto preview\n\nThis should open up a browser window showing a temporary file made by quarto by rendering your website files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nquarto preview will refresh the preview every time you save your index.qmd (or any) website files. So itʻs a good idea to keep the preview open as you make edits and saves.\nCheck every edit, it is easier to debug in small steps.\nTerminate quarto preview with Control-c\n\n\n\n\n\nRender your website to html\nUse quarto to render your content to html, the format used by browsers. First navigate into your website directory then render:\n\n\nTerminal\n\ncd mysite\nquarto render\n\nTake a look at the mysite contents after rendering, you should see a new directory _site (Figure 3). The html was rendered and put in there (go ahead, open up the files and check it out):\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Website files after rendering\n\n\n\n\nPersonalize your content\nWhat is really nice is that you can personalize your website by simply editing the quarto markdown and yaml files.\n\nWeb content goes in .qmd\nUsing any text editor, edit the index.qmd to personalize your website.\nThe first section of your index.qmd is the header. You can change the title and add additional header information, including any cover images and website templates.\nFor example this is what I have in my course website index.qmd header. Note that my cover image is in a folder called images within at the top level of my website directory. If you want to try this out substitute or remove the image line and change the twitter/github handles.\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to Introduction to Data Science in R for Biologists!\"\nimage: images/mycoolimage.png\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/mbutler808\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/mbutler808\n---\n\nYou should edit the body of your website as well. You simply edit the text.\nThe quarto markdown page has great examples showing how to format your content. Take a look at how to specify header sizes, lists, figures and tables.\nTry editing the about.qmd file as well. You will notice that this is another tab in your website. YOu can add more tabs by adding .qmd files.\nWith each addition, be sure to quarto preview your changes to make sure it works. When you are satisfied with your website, quarto render to render to html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nWhen editing markdown, take care to note spaces and indents as they are interpreted for formatting.\nIndentations are really important for formatting lists.\nFor example in a hyperlink, there is no space between the square brackets and parentheses. [This is a cool link](http://mycoollink.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite-wide settings go in _quarto.yml\nAll Quarto projects include a _quarto.yml configuration file that sets the global options that apply across the entire website.\nYAML started off as “Yet Another Markup Language” 😜. It is clean, clear, and widely used. You can edit your YAML to add options or change the format of your website. Take a look at your _quarto.yml.\nHere is an example for a simple website. title: is the parameter to set the websiteʻs title. navbar: sets the menu, in this case on the left sidebar. By default tabs will be named based on the names of the .qmd files, but you can set them manually. There are many themes you can choose from too, check them out. For something different try cyborg.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"today\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: minty\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: true\n\nAgain, after saving your edits, quarto preview to see the effects. When you are satisfied with your website, quarto render to render to html.\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render"

The shell is a software (an app) that allows humans to control the computer. You are already familiar with the GUI interface, or the Graphical User Interface. It is important that you are comfortable using the Command Line Interface as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons to be proficient in the shell:\n\n\n\n\nData analysis increasingly uses many files. The shell provides a simple but very powerful means to do all kinds of operations on files: move, delete, organize, combine, rename, etc.\nUsing the shell encourages you to understand your computerʻs filesystem, and helps you to more precisely control input and output to any place along your file paths.\nShell operations are fast.\nYou can use wildcards to control matching or excluding many files.\nThe shell can be used to execute (run) software.\nThe shell is probably the oldest app, so it is very stable with lasting power.\nIt is part of the OS, so when your apps fail or you are having some issues, you would turn to the shell to kill troublesome processes (programs) or diagnose and fix the issues.\n\n\n\nMacs use the same terminal utilities as UNIX/Linux systems. On the Mac, the command line interface app is called Terminal, which you will find in your Application folder, in the Utilities subfolder (here is a screentshot of our GUI Interface).\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a PC you would use the Command Prompt otherwise known as the Windows Command Processor or CMD. If you used a pre-Windows machine, you would be familiar with MS-DOS. To open CMD:\n\nOpen the Start Menu and type “command prompt” or\nPress Win + R and type “cmd” in the run box or\nPress Win + X and select Command Prompt from the menu.\n\nNote: you may see Windows PowerShell or Windows Terminal instead, these are similar apps."

    "text": "git\nGit is software that implements what is called a version control system for a repository of files (also known as a repo). The main idea is that as you (and your collaborators) work on a project, the git software tracks, and records any changes made by anyone.\nGitHub is an online server and user interface that provides powerful tools for distribution of your repository, bug tracking, collaboration, and also allows you to create easy websites for each repository.\nGit and GitHub together provide an organized way to track your projects, and all of the tools you will need in this course are free.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Whether working solo (A) or collaborating in a group (B) version tracking by naming files is a mess when you want to retrace the steps of the analysis (C). Git and GitHub track all changes and the complete branching tree of the project (D). The commit history is a powerful tool to retrace the development of the project or can be used to roll back to any prior version.\n\n\n\n\n[Source: Jenny Bryan]\nIt is very well suited for collaborative work, as it was developed by Linus Torvalds (in about 10 days of coding!) for collaborative software development of the Linux kernel pretty interesting interview with Torvalds. What it did really well was distributed control, and allowing everyone to have their own copy of the repository.\nGit/GitHub is now the dominant version control system with GitHub hosting over 200 million repositories worldwide! It is used very broadly for all kinds of repos now including data science projects, book projects, courses, and anything that needs collaborative management of mostly text files.\nAnother great and fun read about Git/GitHub and why it is a great tool for data analysis is in this article by Jenny Bryan."

    "title": "Introduction to git/GitHub",
    "section": "What to (not) use Git/GitHub for",
    "text": "What to (not) use Git/GitHub for\nGitHub is ideal if you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/(R)Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.\nGitHub is less useful if you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.\nGitHub also has a problem with large files. Anything above around 50MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once GitHub has choked on a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. This is because the ENTIRE history is saved, including the addition of the huge file. Therefore keep large (>50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.\nFinally, if you have data, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories are public. You can set the repository to private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data (ensure that it is not at risk of identifiability), then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it in a public repo, be very careful!! (And you may need IRB approval, check with your institutional research office.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nGit/GitHub has version control features like a turbo-charged version of “track changes” but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files\nGreat for solo or collaborative work\nSaves the entire history of every change made\nAllows for multiple verisions or “branches” to be developed and later merged\nGitHub allows distributed collaboration (potentially among complete strangers) and has greatly promoted open-source software development, collaboration, distribution, and bug/issue tracking for users to get help\nGitHub allows webpages for your projects or repositories\n\n\n\nNote that other interfaces to Git exist, e.g., Bitbucket, but GitHub is the most widely used one."

Alternatively, there are graphical interfaces.\n\nGitHub itself provides a grapical interface with basic functionality.\nRStudio also has Git/GitHub integration. Of course this only works for R project GitHub integration.\nThere are also third party GitHub clients with many advanced features, most of which you won’t need initially, but might eventually.\n\nNote: As student, you can (and should) upgrade to the Pro version of GitHub for free (i.e. access to unlimited private repositories is one benefit), see the GitHub student developer pack on how to do this."

This software is required for this course.\nIt is important that you have the latest version of R installed. For this course we will be using R version 4.2.1 or higher. You can determine what version of R you have by starting up R and typing into the console R.version.string and hitting the return/enter key. If you do not have the proper version of R installed, go to CRAN and download and install the latest version.\nSome students like to use the Rstudio interface, but this is optional. The RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) requires that R be installed, and so is an “add-on” to R. You can obtain the RStudio Desktop for free from the RStudio web site. You can determine the version of RStudio by looking at menu item Help > About RStudio. You should be using RStudio version 1.4.1106 or higher."

    "text": "Policy for submitted projects late\nThe policy for late submissions is as follows:\n\nEach student will be given two free “late days” for the rest of the course.\nA late day extends the individual project deadline by 24 hours without penalty.\nThe late days can be applied to just one project (e.g. two late days for Project 2), or they can be split across the two projects (one late day for Project 2 and one late day for Project 3). This is entirely left up to the discretion of the student.\nLate days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason no questions asked.\nYou do not get any bonus points for not using your late days, and they are not transferrable.\n\nFor students who exceed their free late days:\n\nI will be deducting 5% for each extra late day. For example, if you have already used all of your late days for the term, we will deduct 5% for the assignment that is <24 hours late, 10% points for the assignment that is 24-48 hours late, and 15% points for the assignment that is 48-72 hours late, etc.\nI will not grade assignments that are more than 3 days past the original due date.\n\n\nRegrading Policy\nIt is very important to me that all assignments are properly graded. If you believe there is an error in your assignment grading, please send an email within 7 days of receiving the grade explaining the issue. No re-grade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than 7 days after you receive the grade for the assignment."

Violations of the UH Systemwide Student Conduct Code includes but is not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; providing copies of your work to other students which is submitted as their own; obtaining copies of said work by others; using copies of said work or representing any portion of another person’s work as your own (i.e., plagiarism); misconduct. While we encourage you to discuss strategies for problem solving, and even collaborate by working through the problems/strategies together, giving someone all the answers is cheating. If you are unsure please ask.\nPlagiarism is when you use information or present ideas, whether by paraphrase or direct quote, from a source (be it published or a classmate) without giving proper credit to that source. Cheating in any way will be reported to the attention of UH Office of Judicial Affairs, and result in an F in this course. Students should be familiar with the policies and procedures specified under the Systemwide Student Conduct Code portal."

    "text": "Prerequisites\nThis is an applied quantitative course. I will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking is useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.\n\nGetting set up\nYou must install R and RStudio on your computer in order to complete this course. These are two different applications that must be installed separately before they can be used together:\n\nR is the core underlying programming language and computing engine that we will be learning in this course\nRStudio is an interface into R that makes many aspects of using and programming R simpler\n\nBoth R and RStudio are available for Windows, macOS, and most flavors of Unix and Linux. Please download the version that is suitable for your computing setup.\nThroughout the course, we will make use of numerous R add-on packages that must be installed over the Internet. Packages can be installed using the install.packages() function in R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, you can run\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nin the R console.\n\nHow to Download R for Windows\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for Windows”\nClick on “base”\nClick on “Download R 4.2.1 for Windows”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFor all software, please download the latest version.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Download R for the Mac\nGoto https://cran.r-project.org and\n\nClick the link to “Download R for (Mac) OS X”.\nClick on “R-4.2.1.pkg” (or the latest version)\n\n\n\nHow to Download RStudio\nGoto https://rstudio.com and\n\nClick on “Products” in the top menu\nThen click on “RStudio” in the drop down menu\nClick on “RStudio Desktop”\nClick the button that says “DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP”\nClick the button under “RStudio Desktop” Free\nUnder the section “All Installers” choose the file that is appropriate for your operating system."
