hi my name is Marguerite Butler speaking
0:03
on behalf of my collaborators Ethan Hill
0:05
Diana GAO Dan Polhemus and Alan Allison
0:08
and we are very excited to share our
0:11
work with you on the amazing astrophryne
0:14
frogs of the papuan region and our
0:16
recent findings about their biogeography
0:18
micro highlights are an extremely
0:21
diverse family of frogs with over 700
0:23
species over half of them are in the
0:26
sub-family astrophyine and they are
0:28
centered in the papuan region while
0:31
there's some species in throughout
0:33
southeast Asia and parts of Australia
0:35
the story is there is just a tremendous
0:38
over abundance of them in the papuan
0:41
region around New Guinea and its
0:43
satellite Islands
0:45
now these are the name species the
0:47
taxonomy is still not complete over the
0:50
past 10 years have been working on the
0:52
phylogeny which was quite complicated
0:54
and we're very excited to report that we
0:57
finally have a highly resolved tree with
1:00
most of the nodes highly supported it's
1:02
revealed that the clade is about 20
1:05
million years old there are 17 Genera
1:08
with most of them having evolved early
1:11
in their history and concordantly
1:13
diversified into five anuran Lifestyles
1:16
which are mostly conserved within Genera
1:19
terrestrial fossorial semi-aquatic
1:21
scansorial and arboreal this phylogeny
1:24
has been really informative about many
1:27
features of the clade which were not
1:29
recognized before for example
1:32
how do we explain these weird disjunct
1:34
distributions the phylogeny revealed
1:37
that we have sister taxa on the
1:39
satellite Islands which are over 300
1:42
kilometers away from the tip but its
1:44
actual sister clade is more like 600
1:46
kilometers away on the mainland
1:48
how do these poor dispersers Traverse
1:51
such humongous distances
1:53
well one hypothesis has to be the role
1:57
of plate tectonics you know you can see
1:59
the plate boundaries even from Google
2:02
Earth
2:03
and you can see the margins of many
2:05
tectonic plates right around the region
2:07
because New Guinea lies in the Ring of
2:10
Fire
2:11
so what is the role of biogeography
2:14
that's the obvious question in
2:16
generating these hundreds of species if
2:19
you recall from geology plate tectonics
2:21
can do all kinds of movements along the
2:24
Earth's surface we can have stresses
2:27
induced by plates shearing plates
2:30
spreading or plates converging and when
2:33
we have convergence what we often have
2:35
at these boundaries are the formation of
2:37
volcanic island arcs these can travel
2:40
along with the plate until they
2:43
basically Collide into another border
2:46
and then accrete onto the Mainland New
2:49
Guinea lies at the juncture of five
2:51
major tectonic plates and many micro
2:54
plates as well
2:56
making it one of the most active regions
2:58
of the Earth
3:00
it's well known that nagini has a
3:03
complex history among geologists it's
3:06
recognized that there are five tectonic
3:09
regions we use these as geo-regions in
3:11
our model and I want to point out to you
3:13
the East poplin composite terrain we
3:16
also recognize the satellite islands
3:18
where the frogs are distributed
3:21
now there are a few points of agreement
3:24
among the geologists in terms of the
3:27
formation of New Guinea as you can see
3:29
from core samples the northern margin of
3:32
New Guinea has a complex composition but
3:35
what's still under debate by geologists
3:38
is how the North Coast was assembled so
3:42
Ethan Hill and Diana GAO my former
3:44
students assembled these hypotheses from
3:47
the literature the first idea was slow
3:51
and steady basically the North Coast was
3:54
formed by the accretion of many many
3:56
many independent events that occurred
3:58
over a slow continuous process
4:02
unfortunately uh the epct in this model
4:05
docked about 20 million years ago with
4:08
the vocal cup docking more recently
4:11
the mobile belt hypothesis alternatively
4:14
says that the epct and the accreted
4:18
terrains
4:19
formed offshore
4:21
separate from the rest of the Mainland
4:24
before docking on to the Australian
4:27
kraton finally we have this recent
4:30
emergence hypothesis for the mainland
4:32
which states that only the high Central
4:35
Cordillera was above water until about 5
4:39
million years ago when the rest of the
4:41
island emerged these make very different
4:44
predictions about the biogeography of
4:47
its terrestrial fauna
4:49
and then finally we have one that
4:51
concerns the formation of the of the
4:54
offshore Islands
4:56
um so Dan pohimus noticed that these
4:59
islands have the same core composition
5:02
as parts of the Owen stanleys from the
5:05
epct and so he posits that these are
5:08
Continental Islands which broke away
5:10
from the mainland and not Oceanic
5:12
Islands that's supported by this
5:14
woodlark riff that's opening up and
5:17
basically carrying woodlark to the North
5:19
and the Louisiana's in this direction
5:23
so we can test these different
5:25
geological ideas with our biological
5:27
data using our time calibrated phylogeny
5:31
with 218 tips as well as a model of
5:35
geographic range Evolution using deck
5:38
models where a range evolves as a
5:41
discrete character and we allow range
5:43
changes by dispersal into new areas
5:46
Extinction from previous areas include a
5:49
Genesis
5:50
and importantly for testing alternative
5:53
models we can actually model different
5:55
ideas about connectivity using these
5:58
dispersal multiplier matrices which
6:01
takes each area and allows us to
6:03
represent whether they are connected or
6:06
not connected
6:07
and we can represent each different idea
6:10
by using a different Matrix
6:14
we can also include time stratified
6:17
hypotheses where land mass Arrangements
6:20
change at different points in their
6:22
history
6:24
these can be compared using a Bayesian
6:27
framework provided by biogeo bears
6:29
software
6:30
and evaluating these models using AIC
6:33
our data basically consists of GPS
6:36
coordinate
6:37
but here are our data 218 samples
6:41
representing all 17 Genera of
6:44
astrophyine across 80 sites across all
6:48
13 geo-regions the five Mainland and a
6:51
numerous offshore Islands let's
6:54
illustrate our biogeographical
6:55
hypotheses with these cartoons so a null
6:58
hypothesis was a current connectivity
7:01
ignoring Geo history so this would be
7:04
basically Island biogeography Theory
7:06
where dispersal within the mainland is
7:09
freely allowed but dispersal to the
7:11
offshore Islands would be much more
7:13
difficult next we have slow slow and
7:16
steady which allows for the sequential
7:19
assembly of the Mainland recognizing the
7:21
different tectonic units which are
7:24
connected by land bridges as they
7:27
accrete then we have the mobile belt
7:29
hypothesis which connects the
7:32
accreditarians and the epct which is
7:35
time stratified and later docking onto
7:38
the mainland and finally we have the
7:40
recent emergence hypothesis with only
7:42
the fold belts available before 5
7:45
million years and then the rest of the
7:47
Mainland coming up later when we compare
7:50
all of these models within our AIC
7:52
framework we have a clear winner which
7:55
is the slow and steady hypothesis
7:57
so going forward we adopt the slow and
8:00
steady for the mainland and then add in
8:03
the islands and so our first idea is
8:06
that the Louisiana's have a common
8:08
history and then we also include the
8:11
woodlark woodlark island with the
8:13
Louisiana's our next idea connects the
8:16
Louisiana's with the epct
8:19
with or without wood lark and then
8:22
finally we are not quite sure whether
8:26
the association should be with the epct
8:28
so all offshore islands are connected to
8:30
the epct or to the accredited terrains
8:33
or we have each offshore island is
8:36
connected to its closest North Coast
8:39
Terrain
8:41
testing everything all together we have
8:44
a clear winner again so we have strong
8:47
support for the slow and steady assembly
8:50
of the Mainland and the offshore Islands
8:53
having
8:54
affiliation with either the epct or the
8:58
accreted terrains applying our model
9:01
back to the phylogeny we can reconstruct
9:04
the history of geographic Transitions
9:07
and we find that they evolved out of the
9:10
epct and we found over 70 dispersals
9:15
so now if we take a look at the sequence
9:18
of geological events next to inferred
9:21
dispersal events we can begin to tell a
9:24
story over 20 million years ago
9:27
astrophrenia arrived on the epct
9:32
about 20 million years ago the epct
9:34
docked onto the mainland at which point
9:37
we could begin to see dispersal events
9:40
from the epct to the accreted terrains
9:42
and to the fold belt and I just want to
9:45
note that these are independent
9:47
migration events but what's listed here
9:49
are the different Genera that they come
9:51
from
9:51
moving on uh 15 to 10 million years ago
9:55
the accreted terrains are getting much
9:57
larger
9:59
the high mountains are rising and the
10:01
louisianas are beginning to break apart
10:03
from the Owens downlays we have
10:06
dispersal from the epct
10:09
to the fold belt to the accreted
10:11
terrains and then to the offshore
10:13
islands in the more recent 10 to 3
10:16
million years ago we have continuing
10:18
dispersal out of the accrediturines to
10:21
the Philippines and Indonesia as well as
10:24
the other terrains and then continuing
10:27
dispersal to the offshore Islands as
10:30
they are moving away we start to see
10:32
that dispersal is tapering off
10:36
New Britain is getting closer and closer
10:38
to the mainland and finally in the most
10:41
recent Epoch it's as close as it's ever
10:44
been and we finally have some dispersal
10:46
from the mainland to New Britain
10:49
and we have continuing dispersal out of
10:52
the epct pretty cool huh we can begin to
10:55
understand some of our previous results
10:57
which didn't honestly make a whole lot
11:00
of sense
11:01
communities based on species coexistence
11:05
at different sites and there are
11:07
numerous multi-species communities that
11:11
we recovered they all occur from our
11:14
data set mostly along the North Coast
11:16
well now this starts to make sense and
11:20
importantly we don't find any evidence
11:22
in support of biogeography Theory which
11:25
would predict that close Islands would
11:27
have more species instead we have the
11:30
largest closest island with only two
11:32
species but we have this tiny Island far
11:35
away with seven species
11:40
we have extremely high generic diversity
11:43
which supports the idea of numerous
11:46
independent colonizations very low rates
11:49
of insight to diversification we can
11:51
reality check it with data compiled from
11:53
the iucn red list and when Diana
11:57
downloaded the shape files and mapped
11:58
them we find a pretty reasonable
12:00
distribution of astrophyiny composed of
12:03
over 150 species with most of the
12:07
co-occurrence along the North Coast
12:09
which is exactly in line with our data
12:13
set so in conclusion we found that by
12:16
using really poor dispersers we can
12:20
actually find great evidence of past Lan
12:23
connections as noted by Sir Alfred
12:25
Wallace and find out many interesting
12:27
things about our group we showed that
12:30
biology can provide excellent
12:32
information to test geological
12:34
hypotheses we found strong evidence for
12:37
a slow and steady assembly of the
12:39
Mainland of New Guinea and the rifting
12:42
off of the louisians and woodlark from
12:44
the Owen stanleys plate tectonics
12:47
provides ample geological opportunity
12:50
what I mean is that frogs evolve by
12:53
dispersal and cladogenesis onto either
12:56
accreted land masses or dispersal over
13:00
small water gaps as islands are either
13:02
breaking away or coming closer into
13:05
proximity that explains The Coincidence
13:08
of numerous independent colonizations
13:11
over a narrow time window and allows the
13:15
formation of complex communities with
13:17
high generic diversification and
13:19
explains the seemingly crazy disjunct
13:22
sister toxic distributions between
13:24
distant islands and the mainland so that
13:27
frogs did not have to swim across the
13:29
open ocean which they don't do very well
13:32
they only had to very rarely this
13:35
demonstrates the potential and
13:37
importance of non-adaptive processes
13:39
combined with early adaptive radiation
13:42
to massively multiply biodiversity
13:47
we have many many people to thank
13:50
and to see more of our work about this
13:53
amazing group please check out my
13:55
students talks on sigbee plus kasau is
13:58
speaking on a phantophanie and Allison
14:01
Fisher on Oriophryne and these are
14:04
two very weird taxonomic puzzles that
14:08
have pretty exciting conclusions for
14:10
convergence in montane frogs and a
14:14
puzzling enormous genus of arboreal
14:16
frogs I'd like to thank our field teams
14:20
it was a lot of fun and very hard work
14:23
and finally I'd like to thank marvely my
14:27
postdoc advisor and her late husband
14:30
Dave who both introduced me to the
14:33
beauty and wonder of amphibians what
14:36
incredible biodiversity and always
14:39
encouraged all of us to go for it you
14:43
know and their their vote of confidence
14:45
in our ability to solve the hard
14:49
problems and just explore is is just
14:53
Priceless thank you
